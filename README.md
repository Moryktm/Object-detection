# Object-detection
This script is for detecting objects in video. So you need some files in order to run it such as yolov8.cfg, yolov8.weight and coco.names.You already have yolov8.cfg and coco.names in the yolo_files folder but you'll have to download 
yolov8.weight. In fact yolov8.weight is outweighted for pushing it in github, that's why I did not put it into the folder, so once you download it, put it into yolo_files.
I let you explore this website (below) where you can see a guide to how detecting an object in the video and also links for downloading the required files (yolov8.weight).
